- Refactoring pass on onagal_fs, its a rats nest in there
- Possible refactor with onagal.images as well
X Figure out how to pass filter state between image :index and :show
- handle inter-page paging (paging boundaries just loop the page currently)
- handle case where changing to an empty pageset while in :show breaks everything
